# Welcome!

Welcome to the data repository for the paper 'SimJogja: A Spatial Microsimulation Approach to COVID-19 Vulnerability and Impact Assessment of the Local Labour Market.'
The data associated with and used in the paper are stored here.
This repository is a rudimentary, and will only store the data used without much guides for now.

Further inquiries on the data can be addressed to my email address at satya.immanuel@gmail.com.

Thank you.
